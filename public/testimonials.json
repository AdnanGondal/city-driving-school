He has made me a much better and safer driver and gave me confidence to pass my test on the first attempt! I would highly recommend City Driving School and Farooq",

This was very important for me because I was very nervous. Our lessons were always completed with feedback and on things that would require improvement and he guided me all the way. He is a dedicated instructor and really puts his students first. I can’t recommend him enough. Because of the way he taught me, I was able to pass the very first time! I would highly recommend working with him if anyone is looking to start taking lessons. He is the best!",
